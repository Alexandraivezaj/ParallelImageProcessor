ParallelImageProcessor

A C++ image processing project that compares the performance of base
 vs OpenMP vs MPI using OpenCV.

Project Goals

- apply common image enhancement techniques like: Gaussian blur and Canny 
edge detection
- Speed up processing using OpenMP for multi core parallelism
- Measure and compare performance so the execution time
